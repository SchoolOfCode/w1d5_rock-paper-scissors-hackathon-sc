// ## Task 7: Get the player's name using a prompt

// Create a username `prompt` and use the username the player inputs in the game so that a player 
// can see their name in the messages sent to them.
// ==> make variable for username


// To make it more uniform, restrict the number of characters a username can be to 10 or fewer.
// ==>if statement to limit length of string and save to variable. if more than 10 create alert using while loop

// This will be deemed as complete when the users cannot enter a username longer than 10 characters.
// ==> Refractor the alert to username

// ðŸŒŸ BONUS: Make it so that valid usernames should only start with letters, not numbers or symbols.  
// ðŸŒŸ EXTRA BONUS: Make it so that the first letter of the username should be capitalised.

//How many times does something beat and lose or draw?
//Something can win twice and lose twice.



// How would you go about making the computer win every time?
    //Asking what the human enters and then get the computer to select a choice that beats it
        //Store all possibilities in arrays
// How would you go about making it so that the computer wins more often (1/2 the time, 1/4 of the time 90% of the time)?
    //Create function where you can pass in a probability between 0-100% (either user-entered or hard-coded by programmer)
    //OR 
// Plan how you'd go about implementing this (use pseudo-code).

// If you have time, see if you can start writing this.
